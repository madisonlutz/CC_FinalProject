// GAME 3 -- MACAW EATING HABITS

//This game is inspired by this p5.play example
//http://p5play.molleindustria.org/examples/index.html?fileName=collisions2.js#

//The user will control a macaw and have to collect the various foods that macaws eat
//after 'eating' the different foods, a pop-up will give more information about that
//specific food in relation to the macaw's diet

//I am still having issues with sprites within p5.play but I have made arrangements for 
//Kelly to help me with this during Tuesday's
